--------------------
-     Features     -
--------------------

The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with 
a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
	
	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
	
	gravityMean
	tBodyAccMean
	tBodyAccJerkMean
	tBodyGyroMean
	tBodyGyroJerkMean

All features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].




--------------------------------------
-     Transformations performed      -
--------------------------------------

1) Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation have been extracted form the initial data sets.

2) The data in subject_train.txt and y_train.txt have been added to the data in X_train.txt as two new columns.

3) The data in subject_test.txt and y_test.txt have been added to the data in X_test.txt as two new columns.

4) The training and the test sets have been merged into one data set.

5) The resulting data set has been labeled with the labels "Subject", "Activity", 
   and the corresponding feature names in features.txt, removing the characters "()".
   
6) Activity numbers have been replaced by descriptive activity names ("LAYING", "WALKING", etc.).

7) A second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject has been created.

8) The string "_average" has been added at the end of each feature label in this new data set.

9) This data set has been written into a file called "tidy_data_set.csv" inside the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
